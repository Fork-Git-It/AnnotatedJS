# TODOs

- update libs to latest possible Ecmascript
- export initialization method that takes the application configuration which will include optional implementations
  - It should try to fallback to service worker implementations
- figure out if it is possible to inject a service through the constructor
- find a way to configure where to look for classes and add them without needing to import them explicitly
